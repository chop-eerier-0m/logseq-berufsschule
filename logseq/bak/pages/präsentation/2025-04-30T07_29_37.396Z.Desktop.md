- #### prep schedule
	- ### 📅 **Presentation Prep Timeline (April 30 – May 13, 2025)**
	- #### Overview
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Presentation topic**: *AI – Comparison of Different Large Language Models (LLMs) and Overview of AI Application Areas*
		  >A structured overview comparing various LLMs (like GPT, Claude, etc.) and explaining how AI is currently used across different fields.
		- **Key message**: "Large Language Models are transforming how we interact with technology, and understanding their differences and applications is key to using AI responsibly and effectively."
		  
		  **Start**: April 30, 2025  
		  **Due by**: May 13, 2025  
		  **Presentation duration**: ≥ 5 minutes

	- #### 📍 **Phase 1: Research & Topic Framing (April 30 – May 2)**
	- **Goal**: Understand and collect credible info for both Topic 1 and 2
	- Research different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, LLaMA)
	- Gather data for “Einsatzgebiete” (chatbots, translation, content gen, etc.)
	- Save sources for citations
	- Decide which two LLMs or concepts you’ll contrast
	- Draft notes for:
		- **Topic 1** Comparison of Different Large Language Models (LLMs)
		- **Topic 2** AI Application Areas
		- **Current state**
			- As of 2025, LLMs are becoming more **multimodal**—meaning they can understand and generate not just text, but images, code, and more. Models like **GPT-4 with Vision** and **Gemini** are examples. LLMs are also being deployed **on devices**(e.g., smartphones), offering faster and more private interactions.

		- **Future outlook**
			- LLMs are expected to:
			- Become **more personalized** (custom AIs for individuals and companies).
			- Improve **reasoning and factual accuracy**.
			- Be used as **collaborators** in research, education, and creative projects.
			- Introduce **regulatory and ethical debates** on misinformation, bias, and AI rights.
			  
			  Their impact could reshape **work**, **education**, and even **governance**.

	- #### 📍 **Phase 2: Outline & Structure (May 3 – May 4)**  
	  **Goal**: Fill out the outline with your researched content
	- Use your provided outline format
	- Make bullet points or short summaries
	- Ensure each section flows logically
	- Begin thinking how each part maps to ~1 minute of speaking time
	- Identify key sources to cite under each topic
	  
	  🕒 Suggested time: 1–2 hours total
	  
	  ---
	- #### 📍 **Phase 3: Slide Creation & Visuals (May 5 – May 8)**  
	  **Goal**: Turn outline into a clean, visual presentation
	- Create ~5–7 slides total
		- Title slide (class, name, date)
		- Topic 1
		- Topic 2
		- Current State of AI
		- Future Outlook
		- (Optional: Conclusion / Sources)
	- Add graphics: simple diagrams, AI model comparisons, icons
	- Keep text minimal: aim for speaker notes, not dense slides
	  
	  🕒 Suggested time: 1–2 hours/day
	  
	  ---
	- #### 📍 **Phase 4: Script / Speaker Notes & Feedback (May 9 – May 10)**  
	  **Goal**: Write what you’ll say for each slide
	- Draft full or partial speaker notes (or a short script if helpful)
	- Time yourself — aim for ~1 minute per slide
	- Read aloud and revise for clarity
	- Ask a friend or classmate for feedback if possible
	  
	  🕒 Suggested time: 1.5 hours/day
	  
	  ---
	- #### 📍 **Phase 5: Rehearsal & Final Edits (May 11 – May 13)**  
	  **Goal**: Get comfortable and polished
	- Rehearse daily (2–3 times, ideally timed)
	- Final tweaks to slides or script
	- Prepare printed notes or backup USB if needed
	- Confidence-building: focus on tone, pacing, eye contact
	  
	  🕒 Suggested time: 30–60 min/day
